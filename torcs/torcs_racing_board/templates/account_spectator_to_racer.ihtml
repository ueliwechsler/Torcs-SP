			<h3>Become a Racer</h3>
			<p>
				Here you can transform your 'spectator' account into a 'racer' account. If you are
				a racer you can
				attend to races with your robot on this site, so this makes just sense if you already have a
				robot to race with. To check if you are competent you have to fill in the quizz below without
				errors.
			</p>
			<p>
				The quizz consists of a selection of 15 random questions from a bigger set. If you fail you
				can come back again, perhaps the new set of questions is more familiar for you. You can try
				as often you like, there is no limitation. You can find most of the answers in the robot
				tutorial and in TORCS itself. For a few questions you have to switch on your brain for a
				glimpse or to search the web. Have fun and good luck.
