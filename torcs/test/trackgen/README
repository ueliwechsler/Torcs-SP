Test data and scripts for trackgen.

data: required for XML processing
source: original tracks as reference
generated: generated track to check if trackgen delivers the same result
generate.sh: scripts to generate all tracks for verification/comparision
clean.sh: script to clean up generated tracks

After a change in trackgen you can run generate.sh to run trackgen on all
tracks, then you can compare the source and generated directories to check
if the output is still the same.
